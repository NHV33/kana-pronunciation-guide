## How to Use:
- Download a webpage with your browser (using ctrl+s, etc.).
- Open the html file in a text editor.
- Save the script.js file to the same folder as the .htm or .html file.
- Paste <script src="script.js" async defer></script> inside the <body></body> section at the very bottom.

When pasted, it should look something like this:
```html
    <script src="script.js" async defer></script>
  </body>
</html>
